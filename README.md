# READ ME :

Here is a simple use of the tool:

### If you don't have Python :
0) Download Python 3.9 or later here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

### If you already have Python :
1) DO NOT separate or rename "auto_config.pyw" and "AutoConfigUIBeta2.pyw"

2) Run "AutoConfig UI" with Python previously installed

3) Choose your desired slot (from 0 to 7) or Extra slot (from 8 to 99)
   - PS: Extra slots are only compatible with Arcropolis 3.6.0 and later. See here :https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis

4) Select the ROOT directory of the mod folder

5) Click on "Generate"

6) Wait a second, the program will generate a config.json file in the root of the chosen directory

7) Ready !
